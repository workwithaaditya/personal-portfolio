# Personal Portfolio (Fresh Reset)

This repository was reset on 2025-11-13.

## Current State
Minimal baseline with only version control metadata. No framework, no dependencies.

## Next Steps
1. Decide tech stack (e.g. Next.js + Tailwind + Prisma/Postgres).
2. Initialize project scaffold.
3. Add environment variables template.
4. Implement core layout and routing.

## Rollback
Previous full project preserved at git tag: `backup-before-wipe-2025-11-13`.
You can restore by checking out that tag or creating a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b restore backup-before-wipe-2025-11-13
```
